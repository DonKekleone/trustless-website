    <section class="book-copy">
      <p>Listen up. We’re done paying first and praying later.<br>
      This ain’t church. This is business. In our swamp, promises get tested… or payments don’t move. Capisce? 😎</p>

      <h2>🧱 What you’re getting (no fluff, all steel)</h2>
      <p>The Book of KEK is the little black book the wise guys whisper about—short chapters, heavy lessons, and a Trustless Mindset + Trustless System that makes scams tap out before they waste your oxygen.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🧠 Mindset that bites: the 9-word boundary that kills 80% of nonsense on contact.</li>
        <li>🧾 Proof-Then-Pay, codified: turn talk into milestones → releases → refunds (on rails).</li>
        <li>👁️ Hype detector: two signals that slice through charisma and catch the lie before it lands.</li>
        <li>🧘 Rituals that stick: simple reps that install new reflexes in your gut (so you don’t fold at 2 a.m.).</li>
        <li>🔧 Mechanized integrity: a peek at the tool that enforces your rules automatically—no begging, no gatekeepers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🐸 The Family Business (how the flywheel turns)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Book teaches the code of conduct (in your bones).</li>
        <li>Bot runs the rules (escrow, milestones, auto-release/refund).</li>
        <li>Tokens grease the machine (utility + incentives).</li>
        <li>NFTs are the heart of the Trustless empire—community, culture, and rewards.</li>
        <li>You stop leaking time to clowns and start shipping value like a boss.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🩸 A quick story from the streets</h2>
      <p>Kek paid first. The “king” vanished. Rent cried. Pride bled.<br>
      Then he rebuilt his operating system—how he thinks, what he tolerates, and the rails his work runs on.</p>
      <p>That OS is what you’re holding: The Book of KEK.<br>
      Not a pep talk. Not a whitepaper. A weaponized philosophy that rewires the reflexes you use when money, promises, and people collide.</p>

      <h2>🧭 Two Tracks. One Outcome.</h2>
      <p><strong>Track 1 — Trustless Mindset (Personal OS):</strong> Boundaries, incentives, proof-then-pay habits baked into reflex.</p>
      <p><strong>Track 2 — Trustless System (Practical Rails):</strong> Escrows, milestones, releases, refunds. Conditions met → value moves.</p>
      <p>Mindset makes you hard to exploit.<br>System makes you easy to work with.</p>

      <h2>⚔️ Why this hits different</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Written to integrate, not impress. Stories + sharp rules that run under stress.</li>
        <li>Personal development with teeth. Confidence grounded in verifiable process.</li>
        <li>Heavy knowledge that changes how you negotiate, hire, build, and sleep.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Big Promise:</strong> Finish this book and you’ll think cleaner, decide faster, and stop bleeding time to people and systems that never deserved it.</p>

      <h2>👥 Who this book is for</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>People burned but unbitter—they build systems.</li>
        <li>Anyone who believes character matters and code can help enforce it.</li>
        <li>Builders, devs, designers, artists, service killers who want to be kind without being naive and firm without being toxic.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Not for:</strong> hype-chasers, entitlement, or “pay me first then I’ll think about it” energy.</p>

      <h2>📜 The Don’s Orders</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Stop trusting. Start verifying.</li>
        <li>Stop apologizing for boundaries. They’re the gift.</li>
        <li>Stop hoping for better people. Build better rules.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🟩 Your move</h2>
      <p>The book’s free. The upgrade isn’t.<br>
      Read one chapter tonight, and tomorrow you’ll walk different.</p>
      <p><strong>Grab The Book of KEK.</strong><br>
      Read to change your defaults.<br>
      Use the bot when talk turns to terms.<br>
      Join via tokens/NFTs if you want to help build the future.</p>
      <p>(No promises, no price talk—just participation in a system that rewards delivery and punishes nonsense.)</p>

      <p><strong>Make ’em earn it—or they don’t earn anything. 🐸💣🟢<br>
